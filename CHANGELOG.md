## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

The first release.

### Added

- The `fauxcall` Claude Code plugin, with the `/fauxcall` skill to build fakes and the
  `/fauxcall:refresh`, `/fauxcall:verify`, `/fauxcall:extend` and `/fauxcall:serve` companion
  skills.
- Inputs: OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger 2.0 documents, Swagger UI and Redoc pages, free-form API
  documentation pages, and remote MCP servers over Streamable HTTP or the SSE transport.
- Recording: paced and capped real calls, one up-front approval for mutating calls, credential
  redaction and consistent pseudonymization of personal data.
- Analysis: schema and field-profile inference, time-format detection, clock-following fields,
  relations, async-job state machines, write semantics, error shapes, and ad-hoc SQL over
  recordings.
- The engine:
  - Consistent worlds with relations and invariants, and per-session state and clocks.
  - Time-aware field policies, including trading calendars.
  - The real API's errors, auth, latency, rate limits, pagination and routing quirks.
  - Async jobs, file uploads and downloads, Server-Sent Events, chunked streams and WebSockets.
  - MCP servers with OAuth.
  - An admin API: reset, clock control, the call journal, fault injection and users.
- Generated fakes: uv/FastAPI projects with tests, a Dockerfile, compose and CI, which pass ruff,
  mypy --strict and a 95% coverage gate out of the box.
- Parity testing: a pytest plugin that runs scenarios against the real service and the fake, and
  scores them with weighted checks (98% required).
- Optional Jev (TypeSafe) judgments for matching unseen requests, semantic outputs and job
  outcomes, with cached answers and deterministic fallbacks.
